# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** at the repo root.

If any of these files do not exist, **proceed silently**. Do not flag their absence and do not suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (this repo):

```
/
|- CONTEXT.md
|- docs/adr/
|  |- 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
|  '- 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
'- src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need is not in the glossary yet, either reconsider the term or note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) - but worth reopening because..._
